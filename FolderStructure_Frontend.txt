React Redux File Folder Architecture and React Router Setup
We will set it up on basis od scenes or essentially how the UI looks
We will have-
Homepage
Profile Page
Login In Page
Navbar-Will exist globally
Components-That are shared
Widgets-Post Widgets,User Widgets,Friends List Widgets
So We will set up basically portals by creating a scenes Folder for layout and sectioning-Setup Layouts for our Components
We will have them as JSX Files as they are Javascript files containing React Components
Components-We can reuse throughout
State Folder-For Redux and toolkit information
We will keep our data and components separate
